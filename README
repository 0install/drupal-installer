Drupal Installer (via 0install)

Copyright Thomas Leonard, 2012


INTRODUCTION

This Drupal installer/updater can be used to create and maintain a Drupal
installation. When run the first time, it uses 0install to download Drupal and
any configured plugin modules. Running it again will download updates, if
available.


INSTALLATION

Get Apache and MySQL from your distribution. For example, on Debian systems:

$ sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql


USE

Copy site-config.xml.template as site-config.xml.
Edit site-config.xml to use your site-specific details:

- doc_root [/var/www/drupal]
- apache_user [www-data]

You can also add extra modules here. When setting up a new site, it is best to
start with no modules and add them later after the initial configuration is
complete.

To start, run:

$ ./update-or-install-drupal.py

You will need to set the owner of some directories to the Apache user (the script
cannot do this itself, unless run as root). If you need to do this, you will see e.g.

chown failed: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/var/www/drupal/sites/default/settings.php'

You can set the ownership manually like this:

$ sudo chown www-data /var/www/drupal/sites/default/settings.php
$ sudo chown www-data /var/www/drupal/sites/default/files

Open your new site in a browser and follow the normal Drupal configuration steps:

  http://localhost/drupal/
